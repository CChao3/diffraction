<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><i>"The subtle pattern of light and dark fringes seen in the geometrical shadow when light passes an obstacle...is an example of the wave 
phenomenon of diffraction. Diffraction is a product of the superposition of waves--it is an interference effect. Whenever a wave is obstructed, 
those portions of the wave not affected by the obstruction interfere with one another in the region of space beyond the obstruction."</i>

<p>In 2060 CE, Asteria Corporation opened its first research compound on the minor planet Sagarentii, to research the Sagarentii palm--a tree that 
produces oils convertible for biodiesel. But the Sagarentii palm groves were guarded upon their arrival, by creatures with reptilian faces,
moving across the land on giant, serpentine tails: this was humanity's first contact with the aliens that came to be known as Croakworms.</p> 

<p>Croakworms are a sentient, but primitive species residing in Sagarentii's khalkedon caverns. They are clothed in little more than rags, 
and are armed with spears and knives coated with toxins from their skin. They feed on the fruit of the Sagarentii palm, and hold agricultural 
rituals in which they scatter their own blood meal to keep their Sagarentii palm groves fertile. They have no written language, and communicate 
through long, frog-like calls from which their name is derived. Additionally, Croakworms have no formal system of government. Their closest semblance 
to social order is their insistence on color-based division within their communities. Roughly half of a community's Croakworms will be black, while the other half will be white. Because black Croakworms are noctural, and white 
Croakworms diurnal, the two colors never mix except at dusk and dawn. No other Croakworm colors have ever been observed, with the exception of 
<span class="gray">gray,</span> which the Croakworms consider a mutant color. Many Croakworms had sought to eliminate the 
<span class="gray">mutant color</span> from their communities by <span class="gray">killing</span> gray Croakworms, but the mutation continued to be 
<span class="gray">spread.</span></p>   
   
<p>Asteria Corp. offered to help Croakworms research a way to end the gray mutation, in exchange for access to the Sagarentii palms. Communities
that agreed were relocated to the Asteria Research Compound (ARC), where they became genetic research subjects. Other communities, especially those 
that refused to kill gray Croakworms, have rejected the bargain and continued to block access to their groves. Recently, an organized collective of 
communities, who call themselves The Recovering, have started a guerilla war against Asteria Corp. in an attempt to disrupt its research and outreach
efforts to persuade remaining Croakworm communities to come to ARC.</p>

<p>To combat The Recovering, Asteria Corp. has created a group of genetically enhanced Croakworms called The Modeled Minority. These enhanced 
Croakworms--known as Models--are being trained to convince all Croakworms to embrace the ARC. But just as much as they are corporate ambassadors,
the Models are also cultural ambassadors, advocating for the ultimate merits of embracing humankind. Someday, we hope our Models may help spread
civilization to every planet. But until then, we invite you, visitor, to see our current progress.</p>
