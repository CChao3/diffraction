<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In 2060 CE, Asteria Corporation opened its first research compound on the minor planet Sagarentii, to research the Sagarentii palm--a tree that 
produces oils convertible for biodiesel. But the Sagarentii palm groves were guarded upon their arrival, by creatures with reptilian faces,
moving across the land on giant, serpentine tails: this was humanity's first contact with the aliens that came to be known as Croakworms.</p> 

<p>Croakworms are <span class="black">a sentient, but</span> primitive <span class="black">species residing in Sagarentii's khalkedon caverns. 
They are clothed in little more than rags, and are armed with spears and knives coated with</span> toxins <span class="black">from their skin. 
They feed on the fruit of the Sagarentii palm, and hold agricultural rituals in which they scatter their own blood meal to keep their Sagarentii palm groves fertile. They have no written language, and communicate 
through long, frog-like calls from which their name is derived. Additionally, Croakworms have no formal system of government. Their closest 
semblance to </span>social order is <span class="black">their insistence on color-based division within their communities. Roughly half of a community's Croakworms will be black, while the other half will be white. Because black Croakworms are noctural, and white 
Croakworms diurnal, the two colors never mix except at dusk and dawn. No other Croakworm colors have ever been observed, with the exception of 
<span class="gray">gray</span>, which the Croakworms consider a mutant color. Many Croakworms had sought to eliminate the 
mutant color from their communities by <span class="gray">killing</span> gray Croakworms, but the mutation continued to be 
<span class="gray">spread.</span></p></span>   
   
<p><span class="black">Asteria Corp. offered to help Croakworms research a way to end the gray mutation, in exchange for access to the Sagarentii palms. Communities
that agreed were relocated to the Asteria Research Compound (ARC), where they became genetic research subjects. Other communities, especially those 
that have refused to kill gray Croakworms, have rejected the bargain and continued to block access to their groves. Recently, an organized collective of 
communities, who call themselves The Recovering, have started a guerilla war against Asteria Corp. in an attempt to disrupt its outreach efforts to 
persuade remaining Croakworm communities to come </span>join <span class="black">the ARC.</span></p>

<p><span class="black">To combat The Recovering, Asteria Corp. has created a group of genetically enhanced Croakworms called</span> 
The Modeled Minority. <span class="black">These enhanced Croakworms--known as Models--are being trained to convince all Croakworms 
to embrace the ARC. But just as much as they are corporate ambassadors, the Models are also cultural ambassadors, 
advocating for the ultimate merits of embracing</span> humankind<span class="black">. Someday, we hope our Models may help spread civilization 
to every planet. But until then, we invite you, visitor, to see our current progress.</span></p>
