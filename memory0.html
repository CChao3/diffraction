<h2>Memory 0: Extraction</h2>
<p>The first thing you notice about them is their teeth. It’s the only part of their bodies that fluoresce under the light. 
And you’ve never seen bodies like theirs before--faces under translucent shell and nylon hide, tails split into two hinged appendages. 
They look nothing like the Sato or the Gami. And they look nothing like the Jusa--nothing like you.</p>

<p>You follow them as they move through the forest, speaking to each other over radio transmission, their language flowing with foreign tones 
and rhythms. You eavesdrop in wonder and trepidation.</p>
 
<p><span class="black">“Is it true that the worms on this planet are sentient?”</span></p>

<p><span class="black">“I hear they’re always killing each other.”</span></p>

<p><span class="black">“No, they just <span class="gray">kill the</span> ones that are born <span class="gray">gray.</span>”</span></p>

<p><span class="black">“Why?”</span></p>

<p><span class="black">“Because they can change their colors at will.”</span></p>

<p>They’re walking along the river now. Soon they exit the forest, and reach the canyons. You wait for them to make some distance ahead, 
before continuing to trail behind them.</p> 

<p><span class="black">“It’s a mutation. Makes it impossible for them to properly regenerate. That’s how they reproduce, by regenerating from 
broken parts of their body.”</span></p>

<p><span class="black">“So like starfish.”</span></p>

<p><span class="black">“Kind of. But more social. They have these rituals, where they get together and cut their tails off. 
Then they take their tails, and toss them into the water. And a few days later, baby worms slither back to the tunnels of their group on land.”</span></p>

<p><span class="black">“That’s so disgusting.”</span></p>

<p><span class="black">“That’s not all. The babies, they’ll always be born whatever the color their parents are not. 
If their parents were black, they’ll be born white. If their parents were white, they’ll be born black.”</span></p> 

<p>They begin to approach the Gami half of your Ring. You can barely see where the tunnels of your half begin and end; 
the lights are all out at this hour.</p>

<p><span class="black">“They take the newborn worm across the river, to the worms of the opposite color living on the other side. 
And the other side raises that newborn, instead of them.”</span></p> 
 
<p><span class="black">“And the kids, they never find out where they really came from?”</span></p>

<p><span class="black">“No.”</span></p>

<p>They enter one of the tunnels. You flatten your back against the rock wall outside, and listen until the sounds of their movement 
fade into dim echoes. Then you slither in.<p>

<p><span class="black">“Not unless they’re born <span class="gray">gray.</span> Then they remember.”</span></p>

<p>They’re moving slowly, scanning the crystals on each door carefully. You hold your breath as they stop at your burrow.</p> 

<p><span class="black">“We’re grabbing the <span class="gray">smallest.</span> I want four of you guarding the outside. Us two are headed in.”</span></p>

<p>One pulls a tiny, stone-shaped device from their hide. Bright beads of light on the device flash briefly. You hear metallic clicking as 
needle-like legs protrude from the device, and unlock your door.  One pushes your door open, and ushers another inside. Your door swings 
shut behind them. You remain in silence, with the others outside. In the dark you can no longer see the teeth behind their translucent shells.</p> 

<p><span class="black">“It’s not in here. Are you sure we got the right burrow?”</span></p>

<p><span class="black">“We can double-check. Sweep the premises.”</span></p>

<p>You can hear their hinged appendages moving towards you. Panicking, you turn and rush towards the exit.</p>

<p><span class="black">“Wait. I heard something--up ahead.”</span></p>

<p>The sounds of their movement get louder. You start slithering faster, keeping your belly close to the ground. 
You make it out of the tunnel--now you just have to make it to the other side of the river. You close your eyes, and will yourself to change.</p>

<p><span class="black">“There! That’s the Croakworm we’re looking for!”</span></p>

<p>You feel a shiver ripple through your frame, as your skin shifts from gray to black. A soft hiss whistles out from a rifle behind you.</p> 

<p>You dive into the river. The severed tails of the Gami from yesterday are lying inert on the muddy floor. You can still remember the way 
their white blood mixed with the black water, like liquid stars melting against the night. You are still young enough to believe this is freedom: 
to choose when you cross the river, to recognize both halves of your being as one whole.</p> 

<p>The radio voices fade as you swim further away. Moments later, you emerge on the shore, at the Sato side of the Ring. 
You slither towards your tunnel on their side of the canyon. Perhaps tomorrow they’ll have sold out to the humans too, 
and you’ll have to move to another Ring. But you’ve grown used to it. All homes are finite. That is, all homes are temporary, 
and destined for dissolution. Detach. Accept. Transform. Ascend. You are above being bound to a home. You are above being bound to 
return to the same communities, in the same forms. The difference between you and them is, you can’t afford to care about where you are, 
because they have already decided where they want you to be. In this way you are a Modeled Minority. In this way you can afford to break.</p>
