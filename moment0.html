<h2>Moment 0: Enlightenment</h2>

<p>You stand alone in a bathroom, staring into the mirror, studying your new face. Your skin is brown--a foreign color. 
You’re still not used to it after all these cycles.</p>

<p>You look down at the granite countertop. Beside your hand rests a capsule, labelled <strong>“HUMAN VIRAL PILL.”</strong> You open the capsule. 
Take a translucent gray pill. Swallow it, dry. Then put it into your jacket pocket. Exit the bathroom, quickly--today is Lottery Day. 
You shouldn’t be late.</p>

<p>You stop at the door to the auditorium. The neon sign on the door is missing light in some of its letters. It now reads:</p>

<div style="text-align:center;"><p><strong><span class="black">END</span> THE REEKS</p></strong></div>
<div style="text-align:center;"><p><strong><span class="black">JOIN THE</span> MODELED MINORITY</p></strong></div>

<p>True, you think, but the Reeks have been modeling a minority different from yours. Their type of minority is not destined to ascend.</p> 

<p>“They better fix that soon.”</p>

<p>You turn around. Another Model in human form. You check the identifier on xer jacket: M1-PM. Or Prima, as the humans call xer.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” you reply. “But I think this version works just as well.”</p>

<p>“Careful, M0-BX, you’re risking a trip back to Enlightenment.”</p>

<p>You laugh. “Why, what for?”</p>

<p>“You know what it’s saying, right? The Reeks modeled minority. The Reeks ‘modeled’ us. That’s some deep anti-Ascension bullshit.”</p> 

<p>“Well, who’s to say that we have to be the minority they’re modeling?”</p>

<p>“What other minority could they be modeling?”</p>

<p>You give Prima a hard stare.</p>

<p>“What? Mutant gray Croakworms?”</p>

<p>“<span class="black">Jusa</span>,” you say. “We’re called <span class="black">Jusa</span>.”</p>

<p>“That’s not who we are anymore. We’ve ascended now. You’ve got to detach and accept your new nature.”</p>

<p>“I am detached. I’m detached enough to accept where I came from, instead of feeling like I have to constantly compensate--”</p>

<p>“Shut up.”</p>

<p>“--by putting on some performance of human--”</p>

<p>“Shut up!”</p> 

<p>The two of you silently glare at each other. Prima reaches into xer pocket, and pulls out xer capsule of human viral pills. 
Xe holds it up to your face. “This isn’t a performance,” xe says. “This is science. This is real.”</p>

<p>“That’s not the only reality you’re part of.”</p>

<p>“It’s the only reality I choose to be part of.”</p>

<p>“You think you can choose among your realities?”</p>

<p>You wrap your fingers around Prima’s capsule, and begin willing yourself to change. Xe watches in disgust as your flesh ripples into its 
native form. Your human nose stretches upwards into a hollow, tube-like horn. Your brown skin hardens into gray scales. Your legs fuse into a 
thick, serpentine tail.</p> 

<p>“Isthis notyou aswell?” you croak, your vocal cords interfering with your pronunciation of the human language.</p>

<p>Prima yanks xer capsule away from you. “No,” xe says. “It’s not.” </p>

<p>Xe opens the door to the auditorium, full of Models, all identical with brown skin, silver jackets, and shaven heads. </p>

<p>“I’ll see you inside,” xe snaps.</p> 

<p>The door slams behind them. You will yourself back into human form. Read the sign over again. Reach out to <span class="black">touch the darkened 
letters</span>, in their cold plastic casing. Pull back. Put your fingers around the door handle. And open. The lights in the auditorium are dimming. 
You squeeze into a seat in one of the back rows, between two hulking Reinforcer Models. 
Applause crescendos as the human announcer appears on the stage with a slip of paper, to read off the Models in each division 
who have been chosen <span class="black">to deploy this month.</span></p>

<p><span class="black">As always, they begin with Extraction. Or, as it is informally known, the detachment division. Detachment, or the first 
step in a Croakworm’s journey </span>to enter <span class="black">Asteria. Croakworms, or Reeks, or minorities before they became modeled. What’s left of a minority after it becomes 
modeled? How many times can you shift the color from your skin, until you blur yourself into </span>blankness<span class="black">?</span></p>

<p>“Mobius.”</p>

<p>Your head jerks up at the sound of your human name.</p>

<p>“Identification code M0-BX,” the announcer continues. “These are all the Models that have been chosen for Extraction. 
Please report to ARC Headquarters immediately for briefing.”</p>

<p>Chairs shuffle as Extractor Models begin to file out of the auditorium. You remain in your seat, tense. The announcer moves on to Enlightenment.</p>

<p>“Hey. Weren’t you just deployed last month?” says the Reinforcer on the left.</p>

<p>You stare at the red curtains on the stage.</p> 

<p>“Wasn’t that supposed to be your last assignment?”</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” you say, rising and moving towards the exit. You throw open the door, run to Headquarters, and enter the briefing room. 
The chairs are empty, save for one, at the head of the table, occupied by the human briefer.</p> 

<p>“Mobius,” she says, “So glad you could find the time <span class="black">to join us today.”</span></p> 

<p><span class="black">Nod. Apologize </span>for being <span class="black">late, while keeping your voice as even as possible. The briefer smiles, and invites you to take a seat, 
to catch up on missed details. You sink into the chair opposite from her, averting her </span>hollow <span class="black">gaze.</span></p>

<p><span class="black">“</span>Where to start...ah. You are aware of the rules of the Lottery, yes?”</p> 

<p>“Models from each division are drawn for missions every month,” you state, quoting from the ARC codebook. “Upon successful completion of 
eight consecutive missions, Models will be granted the opportunity to live on Earth among human society, as a reward for their loyalty and 
service to humankind.”</p>

<p>“And how many Models, Mobius, do you think have made it to Earth since Asteria’s founding?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Guess.”</p>

<p>You fall silent.</p>

<p>“I’m going to let you in on a little secret,” she says. “You know the pills we’ve been giving you? Actually, 
you don’t need to be taking them. We have the technology to make you permanently human. But the mentality required to live as a human is...
fundamentally different than the mentality required to live as a Croakworm. We are afraid a Croakworm will be incapable of adjusting to the changes.”</p> 

<p>She pauses, waiting for your reaction.</p>

<p>“And what,” you mechanically ask, “can I do to demonstrate my <span class="black">capabilities?”</span></p>

<p><span class="black">“Each Croakworm--excuse me, each Model--who has successfully completed eight consecutive missions, is given a final, more 
difficult mission, as a test of their commitment to attain </span>humanity<span class="black">. If they succeed, then we will make them human 
forever.”</span></p>

<p><span class="black">“And </span>i<span class="black">f they </span>fail<span class="black">?</span>”</p>

<p>“The technology works both ways.”</p>

<p>“You can’t be serious.”</p>

<p>“Oh, and there’s a side-effect for gray Croakworms. You’ll lose the ability to change your colors. Not that it matters much anyway. 
If you’re targeted by anti-gray violence in the Compound, just call Reinforcement. They’ll come and protect you.”</p>

<p>You stare at her in horror.</p>

<p>“What else...oh. You won’t be able to regenerate. You’ll live to the end of your normal, 7-year lifespan, at whichever age you became 
permanently fixed at. But hey, at least you won’t have to suffer from hyperthymesia.”</p>

<p>You rise, knocking your chair over. “I’m going to tell everyone what you’re doing.”</p>

<p>Her smile widens. “You say one word, and we’ll force you into permanent Croakworm form immediately. We’ll strip you of your Model status, 
throw you into the most anti-gray sector in the ARC, and tell Reinforcement to look the other way.”</p>
	
<p>“What kind of system is this? You punish us for working to meet your standards, you punish us for challenging the punishment...”</p>

<p>“We’re not inflicting any sort of punishment on you. Like I said, you just have to pass this final test, to prove that you’re an alien 
exceptionally committed to achieving humanity. The only thing that’s holding you back from success, is your own ability--or in this case, 
the lack thereof.”</p>

<p>“Bullshit.”</p> 

<p>“What? The way you’re talking, it sounds like you think you’re doomed. And you haven’t even heard what the mission is yet.”</p> 

<p>“Then tell me.”</p>

<p>She smirks, and slides a file across the table to you. “Your mission is to extract a fugitive Croakworm from a Reek camp, in seven days.”</p>

<p>“Seven days!”</p>

<p>“Mobius, I’m going to make this easy for you. What kind of alien do you want to be? The kind that wallows in self-pity over the bare odds 
xe has for success? Or the kind that fights to beat the odds, no matter how unforgiving?”</p>

<p>You stare at the briefer. “You really think it’s that simple?”</p>

<p>She laughs. “No. But the difference between us is, I can afford not to care.”</p>

<p>The room goes quiet. Somewhere in the office, a door slams shut. The sharp echo of footsteps crack through the hall.</p> 

<p>“I’m curious,” you say. “Why do you say that?”</p>

<p>The briefer frowns. You move closer towards her, scanning the belt at her waist for a holster. You find none.</p>

<p>“Because I’m the one in charge,” she says.</p> 

<p>You continue advancing. She takes a step back into the wall.</p>

<p>“Because humans created the Models. And the Models have to obey.”</p>

<p>You will yourself to change. She screams as your jaws dive towards her throat. You bite down--harder than you meant to. 
You don’t realize this, until after she stops struggling, and crumples in your grip like a corpse.</p> 

<p>You morph back into human form. Turn and flee from the room with file in hand, run down the hallway, down the stairs, out of the building. 
Rush towards the metal gate, separating the Compound from the world outside. Show the border patrol your assignment as authorization to exit. 
It takes all of your courage not to look behind you, to believe that the humans in the Compound have not yet discovered the results of your outburst.</p>  

<p>The gate opens. You enter the dunes outside, and start walking towards the white khalkedon canyons in the distance. The sand clogs your shoes. 
You remove them, and the sand burns your toes. You will yourself to change again, your body aching in resistance. 
Scars break out along your face as it attempts to recontort into its native form. You cry out, stopping the transformation halfway. 
Blood from your injuries starts trickling down, painting your brown skin gray.</p> 

<p>You shrug off your jacket, and press it to the wounds. Stagger on, with a stump of a half-formed tail and flaking scales. 
Stagger on, until you collapse under the heat of the Sagarentii sun, face turned towards the sky. In the corner of your eye, the Compound, 
a silver speck on the horizon, shining brighter than you could ever remember.</p>
