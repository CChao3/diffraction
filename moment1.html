<h2>Moment 1: Modification</h2>
<p>It was a group of black Reeks--no, Sato members of The Recovering--who rescued you. “Reeks” was the human slur. 
You had spoken human so much, that the slur had become a habit--which didn’t help in their opinion of you. 
Frankly, most of the community thought you should have been left for dead. It was only after you told them why you had left the ARC, that 
they decided to let you stay, at least until your body had recovered from the shapeshifting injuries. You had told them you strangled a human 
to protest the ARC’s treatment of the Sato Gami--the aliens humans preferred to call “Croakworms.” They were intrigued. They had never heard of a 
Model rebelling, especially a Model on the human viral pill. So you began to build on the first story, fabricating more instances of how, 
as a Model, you used your proximity to the humans to undermine their power in the Compound.</p> 

<p>But as usual, a few of the Recovering remained guarded, despite your stories. The worst was the community leader, <span class="black">Sa0. 
Xe confiscated your file, the one with the data about the fugitive Croakworm. And you wanted the file back. Deep down, 
you knew what happened with the briefer was an accident--a glitch in the human viral pill, creating an opportunity for your 
<span class="gray">primitive Croakworm</span> instincts to take over. You were certain the Compound would let you back in, so long as 
you proved that you were still committed to humanity. You didn’t even care whether the Compound stripped you of your Model status, as long as 
they could save you from the hell of the outside world.</span></p>

<p>Then there was Lato, the youngest of the community. To be fair, Lato seemed terrified of everyone, avoiding contact with others as much as 
possible. You suspected it was because xe was Jusa, and so used to isolation that xe had learned to self-impose it. But Jusa outside of the 
Compound were always unpredictable. And you weren’t quite sure how to read Lato--you constantly caught xem staring at you with a haunted expression, 
whenever you were testing your shapeshifting abilities.</p>

<p>One evening, Lato wakes you. Xe explains that Sa0 wants to see you in xer burrow, for an urgent matter. Of course you oblige, though you feel 
uneasy about the proposal. Sa0 has never spoken to you at length, and you have no idea what to expect from the conversation.</p>

<p>“M0-BX!” <span class="black">Sa0 waves you over.</span> “Lada saga?” <span class="black">xe asks in your native tongue.</span></p>

<p>“Gasa nuju.”</p>

<p>“1nu!” <span class="black">Xe locks the door.</span> “Saga 1to, 1ga?”</p>

<p><span class="black">You force a smile.</span> “Gasa.”</p>

<p><span class="black">Sa0 nods, and moves over to a table, where your fugitive Croakworm file rests beside a knife. Xe gestures to the file.</span> 
“11 Sato Gami dasa juga. Saga gasa.”</p>

<p>“No, that would never work,” you blurt out in human. “No one can exit the Compound without papers.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I thought,” xe murmurs.</p>

<p>You freeze.</p>

<p>“Yes, I'm fluent," xe says. "I wanted to see how long you’d last before you thought your ideas got too complicated for your 
‘simple’ native tongue to handle.”</p> 

<p>You stare at the file at xer table. “When did you leave the Compound?”</p>

<p>Xe ignores your question, quietly flipping through the file's pages.</p>

<p>“Croakworms that haven’t had the pill can’t speak human," you continue. "Only Models have access to the pill.”</p>

<p>“So to get the pills, I just need to get to the Models,” xe says, smiling.</p>

<p>Your eyes drift back to the locked door. “What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“It’s a shame, M0-BX. Every time The Recovering comes across a fugitive, we hope to make them see reason. But they’re all brainwashed. 
They can’t let go of idea that they can stop humans from oppressing aliens, as long as they prove that they’re worthy of not being oppressed. 
Do you want to know the truth? The humans don’t give a damn about your worth. They’ll only treat you as well as you can uphold their ARC.”</p> 

<p>Sa0 takes a step towards you.</p>

<p>“Is that what you want, M0-BX? To spend the rest of your life in thankless servitude?”</p>

<p>You feel <span class="black">the same anger</span> rising in your head again<span class="black">, the same anger that drove you to strangle the 
briefer</span>. You mentally push it away. “It’s the pills you want, isn’t it? What are they worth to you?”</p>

<p>“There’s always new supply.”</p>

<p>“Then you won’t mind if I get rid of them all right now.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t dare.”</p>

<p>You pull out your capsule, and unscrew the lid. Take out a pill, and crush it between your fingers. Sa0 watches with xer jaw clenched.</p>

<p>“I want to make a deal,” you say. “Give me back my files, and I’ll give you my capsule of pills.”</p>

<p>Xe stares at you for a moment. “Alright,” xe says. Xe holds the files out to you. You keep your eyes locked on xem, as you hold out the pills. 
The two of you gingerly exchange your goods. “Not how I expected this interaction to go,” xe says, “but I’ll take it.” Xe unlocks the door, 
and swings it open.</p> 

<p>Standing in the doorway is Lato, holding a knife.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” xe says, throwing the blade in your direction.</p> 

<p>You close your eyes, bracing for impact--but the impact never comes. You hear the thud of the weapon hit flesh behind you. 
Sa0 is staring back at Lato, horrified, as black blood drips from xer mouth.</p>

<p>You bolt out of the room, snatching the pills from Sa0’s hands as xe falls to the floor. You can hear Lato racing behind you. Suddenly, 
something sharp strikes you in the back. You crash to the floor, as you feel an burning sensation erupt through your body.</p>

<p>“It’s a mild neurotoxin,” says a high-pitched voice behind you.</p>

<p>You twist your neck. Lato is looking down on you, the haunting in xer eyes replaced with a wild ferocity.</p> 

<p>“Like I said, I'm sorry. I just needed your help,” xe says.</p> 

<p>“Like hell you do. How many Models have you all baited and killed to get your group access to the pill?”</p> 

<p>“Many. But that isn’t important right now.”</p>

<p>“Not to you, obviously.”</p>

<p>“Listen, if you help me out, I can us both get off this backwater of a planet.”</p>

<p>“Who said I wanted to get off? Besides, where would we even go?”</p>

<p>“Away from the humans.”</p>

<p>“You can’t get away from humans, they spread themselves everywhere.”</p>

<p>“Of course you can’t. Not when you’ve got beings conning their own species into oppression like the Sato Gami, 
but hey, you’re right, who am I to judge.”</p> 

<p>You scowl as xe squats down, and dangling a tiny vial in front of your face.</p> 

<p>“Now, you’ve been promised a one-way ticket to Earth if you can get that fugitive Sato Gami, right? I was thinking, maybe one of us could 
pretend to be that fugitive.”</p>

<p>“No way.”</p>

<p>“What are you worried about?”</p>

<p>“Do you know what they’re gonna do to me--no, to us, if we get caught? They’re gonna permanently take away our abilities to 
shapeshift and regenerate.”</p>

<p>“Like we’re any freer to use our abilities to shapeshift and regenerate out here? Face it, M0-BX. Sagarentii wasn’t made for the Jusa. 
If I’m gonna get taken out, at least I’m gonna get taken out on my own terms.”</p>

<p>“And then what happens? If we leave, build a new world, who’s to say we won’t be killing each other over some different kind of identity?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we definitely will. But as long as we’re not the ones being killed, what does it matter? What do you Models call it? 
Detach, accept, transform, ascend?”</p>

<p>“And you believe that?”</p>

<p>Xe pauses. “I’ll believe in whatever helps me get ahead.”</p>

<p>You narrow your eyes. “Keep your fucking antidote.”</p>

<p>“Damn, Sa0 was right. You really are a brainwashed one. What a waste. I should just gut you right now.”</p>

<p>“Do it, you coward.”</p>

<p>“Nah.” Lato rises. “Right now, you’re just as useful alive, as you would be if you were dead.” Xe strips off your jacket, 
takes the capsule and file from your numb hands. Xe reads your tattered identification tag, smiling. “M0-BX. Now there's an identity 
I could get used to.”</p>

<p>Lato slithers away, leaving you paralyzed on the floor of the cave. In your mind, you curse xem, hoping xe will be ripped apart by 
bullets from border patrol, or beaten to death by an anti-gray mob. You lay there, festering in your resentment, 
as dusk gives way to night. That’s when you hear the sound of knives being sharpened in the cavern corridor. That’s when you remember.</p>
