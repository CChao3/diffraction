<h2>Moment 2: Reinforcement</h2>
<p>Jusa may not have the ability to regenerate like Sato and Gami do, but their bodies, at least, can feed the next generation. 
Sato Gami tadpoles are born carnivorous. They age out of their desire for flesh.</p>

<p>The doors in the cavern swing open. You can hear the smooth slither of tails on damp earth. Itâ€™s only a matter of time before 
The Recovering find you.</p>

<p>Low croaks ripple through the tunnels. The Song of Creation has begun. You lips, frozen by the toxin, barely manage to tremble along with the tune...</p>

<p>They close in in a circle around you, their black faces and black eyes looming above yours. Their knives flicker silver under the moonlight.</p>

<p>They lift you up, and carry you out of the caverns. They descend to the floor of the canyon, following its path until it reunites 
with the Sagarentii river.</p>

<p>After they throw you into the water, they cut the upper segment of their tails off. 
The segments sink past you with trails of black blood. The trails swirl into an impenetrably thick cloud over your eyes, 
until you can no longer see their faces. And then you feel the river surge into your chest, replacing your breath with flood.</p>
