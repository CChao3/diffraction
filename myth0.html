<h2>Myth 0: D.A.T.A.</h2>
<p><span class="white">All forms are finite. That is, all forms are temporary, and destined for dissolution. 
We suffer because our forms are finite. We live in the constant cycle of death and decay. But it is possible to break free. 
Our suffering comes from attachment to our finite forms. We expect infinity, where infinity is impossible. 
The first step is to </span><strong>DETACH</strong><span class="white"> ourselves from finite forms.</span></p> 

<p><span class="white">After detachment, we can see our forms as they truly are. Our forms are our carriers of information--we use them to transmit 
data among each other, to gather data about our world. The second step is to </span><strong>ACCEPT</strong><span class="white"> that we are carriers. 
The third step is to </span><strong>TRANSFORM</strong><span class="white"> our carrier nature, to transcend the limits of finite form.</span></p>

<p><span class="white">For though our forms may only be carriers, we can choose what forms to carry. We can choose to change the way we process data, 
and the methods by which we transmit. The answer to finite forms, is infinite deconstruction, is to make form indistinguishable from its 
formulation. The answer is to reject all fixing of forms, all clinging to permanence on every scale. We must renounce our identities, 
and break away from the idea of unchanging reality. We must let change push our limits, so that we can </span><strong>ASCEND</strong><span class="white"> 
to the extraordinary. This is the fourth and final step. This is the way to break free.</span></p>
