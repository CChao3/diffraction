<h2>Myth 1: Return Language</h2>

<p>Sato Gami speak a musical, a priori language called Saga. Rather than use a structure that specifies verbs, objects, 
subjects, etc., it is based on the structure of input to output. That is, the structure of “Begins with input X, ends in output Y.” 
Another way to think of it, is that Saga is a language of causality. That is, “reason X, results in cause Y.”</p>

<h3>Vocabulary</h3>
<p>Saga has a pre-designated list of possible inputs and outputs, expressed in terms of unique frequencies. In addition, each frequency 
has its own four-beat rhythm, below notated in terms of dots and slashes. Each dot indicates a beat of silence, while each slash indicates 
a beat of frequency played:</p>

<p>Words in Saga are constructed by combining two frequencies together in an input-output pair. For example, take the word for the name of the 
language itself: “Saga” is made up of the two frequencies “sa” and “ga,” meaning “out” and “in.” Directly translated, “Saga” means “begins with out, 
ends with in.” Within the context of language, the word implies communication--the journey from ignorance to understanding what lies in another’s 
mind.</p>

<h3>Rhythmic Syntax</h3>
<p>In Saga, syntax is conveyed through rhythmic structures. The rhythm of a word’s input frequency is layered over the sustained sound of its 
output frequency. For example, in the word “Saga,” the frequency for “ga” is sustained for four beats, while the rhythm of “sa” is played 
simultaneously:</p>
<audio controls><source src="saga.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio>
<p>Transcribed text notation:</p>
<p>Input: (Silence) Sa Sa (Silence)</p>
<p>Output: Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa</p>
<p>In human transcription of Saga, these rhythmic syntaxes are not written out, for the sake of brevity. Since input always precedes output, 
one can infer the meaning of a transcribed word through order of frequency alone.</p>
