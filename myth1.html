<h2>Myth 1: Install Environment</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class = "code">install environment:</p> 
<p class = "code" style="text-indent:100px;">environment == flood</p>
<p class = "code" style="text-indent:100px;">flood >= buried piles</p>
<p class = "code" style="text-indent:150px;">from buried piles:</p> 
<p class = "code" style="text-indent:200px;">out dark</p>
<p class = "code" style="text-indent:200px;">in light</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the beginning, the world was drowning. The earth had no strength to remain above the water, 
and its sands collected in piles at the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p><s>Start true, in start high start. Low start low true, start true high true end low.</s></p> 

<p>From these piles originated two beings: one was called Sato, and the other Gami.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class = "code" style="text-indent:200px;">from (out dark + in light):</p>
<p class = "code" style="text-indent:250px;">flood <= buried piles</p>
<p class = "code" style="text-indent:250px;">return buried piles</p>
<p class = "code" style="text-indent:200px;">return buried piles</p> 
<p class = "code" style="text-indent:150px;">false</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They lifted the earth upon their backs, and drank from the sea until the water no longer rose above their heads. 
And once they saved the world from drowning, they collapsed from exhaustion, <s>returning to the world from which they came.</s></p>

<p><s>Start true high true end low, start true out dark, in light. Out dark, in light, low high low start, high end high start, low end.</s> 
Out dark, in light, low end end false.</p> 

<p>But to remain returned was not the fate of Sato and Gami. Out dark, in light, out in low start, start true low out. 
Out dark, in light, out in high start, start true out dark in light.</p>

<p><s>From their mixed flesh, originated the trees. And from their mixed blood, originated the mixed forms: the Sato Gami.</s>
